# Contrapunto
Contrapunto is a program which takes a melody and plays it together with a second harmonic one.
To do that, it creates a tree with possible melodies and assigns scores to each node, based on the musical counterpoint rules.
At the end the melody with the highest score is chosen.
This was a suggested project for my undergraduate thesis.
